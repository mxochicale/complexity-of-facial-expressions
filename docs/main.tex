\section{Introduction}
Movement variability is an inherent feature within and between persons. 
Research on measurement and understanding of movement variability has been 
well established in the last three decades in areas such as biomechanics, 
sport science, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and robotics 
\cite{2018arXiv181009249X}.
With that in mind, I hypothesise that the subtle variations of facial 
expressions can be quantified in a similar fashion as with the methodologies 
of movement variability. Hence, I am interested in quantifying the complexity 
of facial expression that one person or multiple can present in scenarios 
of human-robot interaction, particularly I am interested in these two questions: 
(i) can the quantification of the variation of facial expressions tell us 
something about the state of health or the state of mind of a person?, 
(ii) how the quantification of facial expressions can be related with 
the complexity of facial expressions?.


\section{Methods}
Considering the work of my Ph.D. thesis for quantification of movement variability 
using nonlinear dynamics methods \cite{XochicalePhDThesis2018},
I am proposing to work with Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). 
RQA computes measurements based on the recurrence points density of diagonal 
or vertical line structures in Recurrence Plots. 
Such measurements of dynamics can determine the dynamics of a system,
e.g. the determinism (predictability) or Shannon entropy (complexity) 
\cite{marwan2007}. 
Hence, I am proposing to use Shannon Entropy measurement 
from the recurrent quantification analysis (also known as RQAEntr)
to quantify the complexity of face expressions. 


\section{Preliminary results}


Fig \ref{fig:method} shows the proposed methodology with 
some preliminary results of one participant performing three
levels of face expressions.
