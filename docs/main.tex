\begin{abstract}
This proposal will investigate the use of a method from nonlinear dynamics (RQAEnt) 
 to quantify the complexity of face expressions variability and its relationship
with mental states (e.g. anxiety, disinterest, relief).
The proposal contains two research questions,
an introduction to RQAEnt, and a pilot experiment with preliminary results.

\section{Introduction}
Movement variability is an inherent feature within and between persons. 
Research on measurement and understanding of movement variability has been 
well established in the last three decades in areas such as biomechanics, 
sport science, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and recenlty
in human-robot interaction \cite{2018arXiv181009249X}.
Hence, considering methodologies for movement variability 
to quantify complexity of facial expressions variablity 
with its preliminary experiments \cite{MPXochicale_CERE2018},
I am therefore interested in quantifying the complexity 
of facial expression that one person or multiple persons 
can present and in researching 
the subtle variations of facial expressions that can be related to different 
mental states  (e.g. anxiety, disinterest, relief) \cite{back2014}
both in the contex of human-robot interaction.
Such interests have led me to ask two research questions for this
proposal: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
 \item does the quantification of the complexity of facial expressions 
	variability can tell us something about the state of mind of a person?, 
\item how the quantification of facial expressions can be related with 
the complexity of facial expressions?.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}
Considering the work of my Ph.D. thesis where I investigated nonlinear dynamics
to quantify movement variability \cite{XochicalePhDThesis2018},
I am proposing to apply Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to
provide some answers to the raised questions.
RQA computes measurements based on the recurrence points density of diagonal 
or vertical line structures in Recurrence Plots \cite{marwan2007}. 
Such measurements of dynamics can determine the dynamics of a system,
i.e. the determinism (predictability) or Shannon entropy (complexity).
Hence, the use Shannon Entropy with RQA (also known as RQAEntr)
can be applied to quantify the complexity of face expressions variations. 


\section{Preliminary results}
Fig \ref{fig:method} shows the proposed methodology 
where one participant (myself) were asked to perform three levels of variation of face expressions:
(i) neutral, (ii) slow variation and (iii) faster variations.
Figs \ref{fig:method}(B) shows the time series from the $x$ 2D landmarks
for normalised and smoothed time series. 
Fig \ref{fig:method}(C) shows a 3D surface of the RQAEnt for different 
embedding values and recurrence thereshodls 
(see \cite{2018arXiv181009249X} for more about RQAEnt).
