\begin{abstract}
This proposal will investigate the use of nonlinear dynamics tools
to quantify the variability of face expressions and its relationship
with mental states (e.g. anxiety, disinterest, relief) in the context
of human-robot interaction. This proposal contains two research questions,
RQAEnt to quantify variablity of facial expressions, pilot experiment and 
preliminary results.

\section{Introduction}
Movement variability is an inherent feature within and between persons. 
Research on measurement and understanding of movement variability has been 
well established in the last three decades in areas such as biomechanics, 
sport science, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and robotics 
\cite{2018arXiv181009249X}.
Also, considering methodologies for movement variability 
to quantify variability in facial expressions and 
my preliminary experiments of variations 
for facial expressions using nonlinear dynamics \cite{MPXochicale_CERE2018}.
Hence, I am interested in quantifying the complexity 
of facial expression that one person or multiple persons can present in scenarios 
of human-robot interaction and  in researching 
the subtle variations of facial expressions that can be related to different 
mental states  (e.g. anxiety, disinterest, relief) \cite{back2014}.
Such statements have led me to ask two research questions where, 
to the best of my knowledge, little has been done in the context of 
human-robot interaction:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
 \item does the quantification of the variation for facial expressions 
using nonlinear dynamics can tell us something about the state of mind of a person?, 
\item how the quantification of facial expressions can be related with 
the complexity of facial expressions?.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}
Considering the work of my Ph.D. thesis where I investigated nonlinear dynamics
to quantify movement variability \cite{XochicalePhDThesis2018},
I am proposing to apply Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) for this work.
RQA computes measurements based on the recurrence points density of diagonal 
or vertical line structures in Recurrence Plots. 
Such measurements of dynamics can determine the dynamics of a system,
e.g. the determinism (predictability) or Shannon entropy (complexity) 
\cite{marwan2007}. 
Hence, the use Shannon Entropy with RQA (also known as RQAEntr)
can be applied to quantify the complexity of face expressions. 


\section{Preliminary results}
Fig \ref{fig:method} shows the proposed methodology with 
some preliminary results for one participant (myself) performing 
three levels of face expressions.
