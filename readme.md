> This research proposal aims to investigate the use of a method from nonlinear dynamics 
(RQAEnt) to quantify the complexity of face expressions variability and 
its relationship with mental states (e.g. anxiety, disinterest, relief)
in the context of human-humanoid interaction. 
The proposal contains two research questions,
an introduction to RQAEnt, and a pilot experiment with preliminary results.
